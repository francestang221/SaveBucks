BeaverHacks Spring 2021 Hackathon Project

Our web app allows the user to choose a Starbucks drink and the number of cups they have on a daily basis. It then shows them the financial value of making coffee at home as well as the potential future gains if they choose to invest the extra money on a daily basis. We also recommend our favorite ground coffee using Amazon affiliate links and incorporate a Twitter button for the user to share our web app with their friends and family.
